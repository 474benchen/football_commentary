# football_commentary

Project exploring the capacity of GPT (conducted during GPT's beta test). The test consisted of compiling and cleaning football game + commentary data, aligning the commentary to game meta data, and multiple iterations of prompt engineering to generate the final football commentary scripts. A study was conducted based on the results, with all participants struggling to differentiate between the real and fake commentary.

Though the application here is trivial, it presents interesting possibilities for future application of GPT in other fields such as in medicine.
